# Game Description
Bestias is a match-2 card game where the player must find both copies of each card within an array of 9 different designs before time's up. With each session, the deck is shuffled so the cards won't spawn in the same locations, enhancing replayability. There is also a brief tutorial to familiarize players with the game.

# Install Instructions
To play the game, install the "SGX_2019_FinalBuild" folder and run the executable within.
The game was built for Windows.
